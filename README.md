# Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre

Welcome to the **Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre** project! This initiative is a cross-disciplinary effort combining traditional shadow puppetry, modern technology, and artificial intelligence to create an immersive and dynamic performance experience. The project integrates cultural research, modular set designs, AI-driven puppetry, and projection mapping to explore new narrative forms through physical and virtual mediums.

## Overview

The Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre project explores the intersection of art, culture, and technology, focusing on the following core areas:

- **Modular Set Design**: A flexible, reconfigurable set system built using physical and digital elements.
- **Puppetry Design and Fabrication**: Projects involving the process of puppet construction.
- **Puppetry Control**: Collaboration with human, machine, and AI to control virtual puppets.
- **Cultural Research**: Deep exploration of traditional puppetry forms (such as *Wayang Kulit*) and their integration into modern storytelling.
- **Projection Mapping**: Innovative visual designs mapped onto the performance space, blending physical puppets with digital projections.
- **Virtual-Physical Integration**: Creating a seamless interface between physical puppets and their virtual counterparts in a digital environment.

## Key Components

This repository serves as the central hub for the Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre project and is structured into several sub-repositories, each focusing on a different aspect of the project:

- [**Modular Set Design**](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Modular-Set-Design): Research and development of reconfigurable set designs for performances.
- [**Puppet Design & Fabrication**](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Puppet-Design-Fabrication): 3D printing, fabrication, and design of physical and robotic puppets.
- [**AI-Driven Puppetry**](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/AI-Driven-Puppetry): Integration of AI systems to control puppet movements and interactions.
- [**Cultural Research**](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Cultural-Research): Exploration of traditional puppetry forms and cultural narratives.
- [**Projection Mapping**](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Projection-Mapping): Designing and implementing projection-mapped visuals to complement performances.
- [**Virtual-Physical Integration**](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Virtual-Physical-Integration): Bridging the gap between the physical performance space and virtual worlds.

Each sub-repository includes its own documentation, research, and development files. Check out each project for more detailed information.

## Project Goals

1. **Research**: Investigate both traditional and modern puppetry methods, technologies, and narrative techniques.
2. **Design**: Develop flexible modular components for sets and puppets, both physical and virtual.
3. **Produce**: Fabricate puppets, set pieces, and digital assets for performances using advanced technology (e.g., 3D printing, AI).
4. **Perform**: Stage both physical and blended reality performances that integrate all project components.
5. **Assess**: Collect feedback and analyze performance data for future iterations and improvements.
