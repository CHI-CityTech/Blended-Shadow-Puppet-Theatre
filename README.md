## 2025 Project Team

[**Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre (BSP) Spring Production**](https://github.com/orgs/CHI-CityTech/teams/bsp-spring-production)  
The Spring Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre Production, with expanded script, puppets, and technology.  This semester, we integrate front projection, as well as the introduction of textile-based scenery that blends with projection.  We also extend the script, adding a second act (which really may be a scene in a full length version), explore more articulated puppetry, some with machine or mechanism control, compose original music, and engineer a more sophisticated surround sound system with a more elaborate set.

# Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre

Welcome to the **Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre** project! This initiative is a cross-disciplinary effort that seeks to merge the ancient art of Javanese shadow puppetry with cutting-edge video projection and animation technology, creating a captivating fusion of physical and virtual storytelling elements. At the heart of the Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre is a desire to honor and explore traditional Javanese puppetry, an art form steeped in history and rich in narrative depth. By integrating these traditional elements with the dynamic possibilities of 21st-century digital media, the project will offer a unique cultural bridge that spans time and geography. 

Our project team combines traditional shadow puppetry, modern technology, and artificial intelligence to create an immersive and dynamic performance experience. The project integrates cultural research, modular set designs, AI collaboration, 3D fabrication, sound, music, lighting, and projection mapping to explore new narrative forms in blended environemnts that combine physical, virtual, and conceptual mediums.

## Overview

The Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre project explores the intersection of art, culture, and technology, focusing on the following core areas:

## Key Components

This repository serves as the central hub for the Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre project and is structured into several sub-repositories, each focusing on a different aspect of the project:

- [**Modular Set Design**](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Blended-Shadow-Puppet-Theatre/tree/main/Modular-Set-Design): Research and development of reconfigurable set designs for performances. Specific implementations of the Blended Reality Performance System project.
- [**Narrative**](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Blended-Shadow-Puppet-Theatre/tree/main/Narrative): texts, scripts, stories and other narrative development for performances
- [**Puppet Design**](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Blended-Shadow-Puppet-Theatre/tree/main/Puppetry-Design): Projects involving the process of puppet construction.  traditional construction, 3D printing, fabrication, and design of physical, robotic, and virtual puppets.
- [**Audio**](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Blended-Shadow-Puppet-Theatre/tree/main/Audio): Sound reinforcement, playback, and design
- [**Music**](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Blended-Shadow-Puppet-Theatre/tree/main/Audio): Composition and Virtual Orchestra
- [**Puppetry-Control**](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Blended-Shadow-Puppet-Theatre/tree/main/Puppetry-Control): Integration of AI systems to control puppet movements and interactions.
- [**Cultural Research**](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Blended-Shadow-Puppet-Theatre/tree/main/Cultural-Research): Exploration of traditional puppetry forms and cultural narratives and their integration into modern storytelling.
- [**Projection**](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Blended-Shadow-Puppet-Theatre/tree/main/Projection): Designing and implementing projection-mapped visuals to complement performances.
- [**Integration**](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Virtual-Physical-Integration): Creating a seamless interface between physical puppets and their virtual counterparts in a digital environment. Bridging the gap between the physical performance space and virtual worlds.

Each sub-repository includes its own documentation, research, and development files. It will also link to other more specialized repositories that are also participating in teh project.  Check out each project for more detailed information.

## Project Goals

1. **Research**: Investigate both traditional and modern puppetry methods, technologies, and narrative techniques.
2. **Design**: Develop flexible modular components for sets and puppets, both physical and virtual.
3. **Produce**: Fabricate puppets, set pieces, and digital assets for performances using advanced technology (e.g., 3D printing, AI).
4. **Perform**: Stage both physical and blended reality performances that integrate all project components.
5. **Assess**: Collect feedback and analyze performance data for future iterations and improvements.
