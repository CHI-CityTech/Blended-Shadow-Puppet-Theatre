# BSP Set, AV System, and Organza Roll Setup Guide

This document outlines the tasks required to set up:
1. The **BSP set** (including rear-projection/front-projection screens and stage masking).
2. The **AV system** (featuring QLab outputs, surround audio, and projector alignment).
3. The **organza roll mechanism** downstage, with scenic fabric imagery (river and forest scenes), using a **manual/mechanized crank** or pulley system to reveal different scenes.

## 1. Frame and Screen Setup
1. **Confirm Measurements**  
   - Verify stage and screen dimensions:  
     - Central screen: 6’ × 6’  
     - Wings: 6’ × 4.6’  
   - Confirm the 80/20 T-Slot framing matches these dimensions.

2. **Assemble 80/20 T-Slot Frame**  
   - Build the frame according to manufacturer specs.  
   - Ensure proper bracing for stability and safe mounting.

3. **Mount/Attach Screens**  
   - Secure each screen surface (for both rear and front projection, if applicable).  
   - Check sightlines; make sure the audience’s viewing angle is unobstructed.

4. **Check Clearances**  
   - Align the assembled structure so it does not interfere with set pieces, curtains, or audience view.  
   - Verify that any planned masking will fully cover screen edges when needed.

## 2. Projector Placement and Alignment
1. **Identify Projector Positions**  
   - Decide where each projector (RP & FP) will be installed.  
   - Calculate or verify throw distances to ensure correct image size and brightness.

2. **Secure Mounting**  
   - Mount projectors on stable stands, trusses, or ceiling rigs.  
   - Keep them accessible for maintenance and focusing.

3. **Image Alignment and Focus**  
   - Align edges and perform keystone corrections if necessary.  
   - Calibrate brightness, color, and focus for each projector.

## 3. Curtains and Masking
1. **Wing Masking**  
   - Hang black theater curtains to mask the 6’ × 4.6’ wing screens.  
   - Overlap curtains to hide any backstage lighting.

2. **Proscenium Masking**  
   - Hang or install vertical “legs” if additional side masking is required.  
   - Add a border (or teaser) in front to mask the top edge and unify the stage look.

3. **Rigging Checks**  
   - Confirm hardware (pipes, clamps, battens) is secure and rated for the load.  
   - Adjust curtains for optimal coverage with minimal wrinkles or gaps.

## 4. Audio Setup (QLab 8 Outputs, 7.1 Layout)
1. **Speaker Placement**  
   - Plan a 7.1(ish) layout:  
     - Front L, Center, Front R  
     - Side Surrounds (L, R)  
     - Rear Surrounds (L, R)  
     - Upstage speaker (for additional effects)  

2. **Signal Routing**  
   - Connect QLab’s 8 outputs to amplifiers/powered speakers according to your channel layout.  
   - Label interface channels (e.g., Output 1 → Front L, etc.).

3. **Cable Runs and Organization**  
   - Use balanced cables (XLR or TRS) to reduce noise.  
   - Keep cables labeled at both ends for troubleshooting.

4. **Audio Testing**  
   - Test playback levels using pink noise or tone.  
   - Adjust EQ and balance to ensure consistent coverage.

---

## 5. Racking, Cabling, and Power Management
1. **Rack Assembly**  
   - Secure all AV equipment (audio interface, amps, video switchers) in a rack.  
   - Use rails or shelves that support the gear’s weight and cooling needs.

2. **Cable Organization**  
   - Route signal and power cables separately to minimize interference.  
   - Label cables on both ends (e.g., “Output 1 (L Front) → Amp Ch.1”).

3. **Power Distribution**  
   - Use a dedicated power source or conditioning unit for sensitive AV gear.  
   - Avoid daisy-chaining power strips whenever possible.

4. **Documentation**  
   - Create or update a cable map for quick reference.  
   - Record projector settings, audio levels, or any specialized configurations.

## 6. Organza Roll Mechanism and Scenic Imagery
An additional layer of scenic organza is placed downstage of the main projection screen. It may use either a **manual crank** or a **pulley-based system** to reveal different scenes (river and forest).

### 6.1 Design & Planning
- **Determine Desired Scenes**  
  - Confirm how the river and forest images will be shown or hidden.
- **Identify Mounting Location**  
  - Ensure the roll or pulleys can be installed downstage without blocking sightlines.

### 6.2 Fabric Preparation
1. **Measure & Cut Organza**  
   - Cut each scene panel to the correct width and length.  
   - Reinforce edges to prevent fraying.
2. **Check Imagery Alignment**  
   - Verify prints line up and are sized correctly for the visible area.

### 6.3 Mechanism Construction & Installation
1. **Manual Crank Mechanism**  
   - Mount a roller assembly on or above the stage floor downstage.  
   - Attach a hand-crank (or similar device) to control the winding/unwinding manually.
   - Ensure that gear ratios or tensioners keep the organza taut and prevent slipping.

2. **Pulley & Rope System**  
   - Install pulleys in the fly system or grid.  
   - Attach ropes to a batten or bar that holds the fabric.  
   - Label rope lines for easy operation.

3. **Fabric Attachment**  
   - Staple or clamp the organza’s top edge to the roller or pulley bar.  
   - Ensure smooth rolling/unrolling without bunching.

### 6.4 Integration & Alignment
- **Coordinate with Projections**  
  - Confirm the organza does not block main projection or cause undesired translucency.  
  - If intentionally projecting onto the organza, adjust lighting and layering.
- **Avoid Set/Actor Interference**  
  - Confirm the fabric’s path is free of obstacles and safe from performer traffic.

### 6.5 Cueing & Operation
- **Scene Transitions**  
  - Decide when each scene (river or forest) appears.  
  - Integrate cues into the stage manager’s prompt book or QLab if relevant.  
  - If using a manual crank, make sure operators have a clear line of sight and can execute the transition smoothly.
- **Manual Operation**  
  - If using ropes, rehearse and label rope directions, ensuring snag-free transitions.
  - If using a crank, ensure the handle can be locked or secured when the organza is in place.

### 6.6 Testing & Adjustments
- **Dry Runs**  
  - Unroll the organza multiple times; watch for snagging or wrinkling.  
  - Check lighting and projection from the audience’s perspective.
- **Reinforce Weak Points**  
  - Add additional stitching, grommets, or weighting rods to maintain tension.

### 6.7 Final Documentation & Safety
- **Mechanism Instructions**  
  - Provide written steps for setup and teardown.  
  - Label all parts clearly (rollers, rope lines, crank handle).
- **Safety Review**  
  - Use safety cables/clamps for overhead rigging.  
  - Confirm manual crank or rope locking mechanisms to prevent accidental movement.
- **Maintenance & Storage**  
  - Roll up the organza carefully post-show.  
  - Store in a dust-free area to preserve image quality.

## 7. System Testing and Final Checks
1. **Projector Test**  
   - Display test patterns to confirm edge alignment, keystone correction, and color balance.
2. **Audio Calibration**  
   - Use pink noise in each speaker to equalize and check for any hum or distortion.
3. **Masking and Sightlines**  
   - Check from multiple audience angles to ensure curtains/legs/borders are properly concealing unwanted areas.
4. **Organza Mechanism**  
   - Ensure the fabric seamlessly winds or unwinds without interfering with the show.  
   - Verify that no trip hazards remain in the operating area.
5. **Safety & Aesthetics**  
   - Double-check rigging points for security.  
   - Tidy up cables and store spares neatly.

## 8. Final Documentation and Handoff
1. **Create Tech Packet**  
   - Summarize how to power on/off each system (AV rack, projectors, QLab).  
   - Include notes on focus points, channel assignments, and organza operation.
2. **Labeling and Inventory**  
   - Ensure all cables, adapters, and spares are well-labeled.  
   - Keep an up-to-date list of gear for quick reference.
3. **Operator Training**  
   - Conduct a short session on basic troubleshooting (e.g., restarting QLab, reseating cables).  
   - Demonstrate how to operate the organza crank or rope system safely.
