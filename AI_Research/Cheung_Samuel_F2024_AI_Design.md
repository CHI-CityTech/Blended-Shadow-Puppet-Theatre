## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
Throughout history, technology has played a pivotal role in shaping society. From the invention of the automobile to the development of the internet, technological advancements have continuously transformed the way we live. In recent years, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has further revolutionized our interaction with technology, particularly in creative fields. With the advent of text-to-image generation, AI now allows users to create visual art and other content by simply providing textual prompts.

### 1.2 Purpose of the Internship
The purpose of this internship is to explore the capabilities and limitations of AI models in generating content for entertainment, specifically within the context of a Javanese puppet show. The intern will assess the ability of AI to create immersive, coherent, and culturally resonant content, including animated backgrounds, that can be seamlessly integrated into traditional Javanese puppetry. The internship will also investigate the continuity of AI-generated content and identify any flaws or limitations inherent in the AI models used.
