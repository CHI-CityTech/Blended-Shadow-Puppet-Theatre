# README : BSP Music for the Spring 2025 Production
- Music for this production was created for the most part by Osakpolar Noyiagbon, and the raw original files can be found in the associated [Blended Music Repository](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Blended_Music/tree/main/Gamelan_Youruba)  
- Some other music for the preshow used historical Gamelan passages.  The list of potential materials for this can be found here (NEED TO ADD THIS LINK dbs 2025-06-02)  
- A couple of pieces were generated in a collaborative process between David B Smith and MusicFX from google labs.  Material that was improvised in [MusicFX DJ](https://labs.google/fx/tools/music-fx-dj) (through the improvisatory selection of real-time performance text prompts), was then imported into [Digital Performer](https://motu.com/en-us/products/software/dp/) for additional editing, refinement, and the overlay of additional instruxemtns as well as the selective rearrangement of existing bits.  Materials from this experiment can be found directly at [this Dropbox site](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/x30r9c080yoxu4xods8d4/ALxYrQ-Kpy6071oKOwjmfG0?rlkey=p00tv0tpi563vrydq8nxrcfre&dl=0).
